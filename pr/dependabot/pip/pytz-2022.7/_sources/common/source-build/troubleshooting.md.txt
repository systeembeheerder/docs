### Failed to find port_list ‘33d0cd82-57c6-11e1-8ed1-406186ea4fc5‘

This error can occur when tying to use the Task Wizard to create a quick scan
after the initial setup. It is cause by `gvmd` not being able to load the port
lists from the feed into its database. To fix this issue, you need to check if
`/var/lib/gvm/data-objects/` contains the port list XML file:

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Check if port list is already synced
---
find /var/lib/gvm/data-objects/ -name "*33d0cd82-57c6-11e1-8ed1-406186ea4fc5*.xml"
```

If the `find` command does not return an XML file for your release, the data
data objects have not been synced (yet).

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Syncing data objects processed by gvmd
---
sudo -u gvm greenbone-feed-sync --type GVMD_DATA
```

Second, `gvmd` should be forced to (re-)load the data objects including the port
lists from the disk.

```{code-block} shell
---
caption: Syncing data objects processed by gvmd
---
sudo -u gvm gvmd --rebuild-gvmd-data=all
```
